**What is File Signautre?** <br>
File Signature is a data, used to identify and verify content of a file and such signautres are also known as magic numbers or magic bytes. They are usually appended at the beginning of the file.

**How to identify the type in Python?** <br>
In Python, a library called "python-magic"  will allow to identify the files types based on their signatures.<br>
First, we have to install the python-magic library and then import into the script.


### installing python-magic library into Visual Studio Code

    pip install python-magic

### Create a python source

    Just copy paste you python script that contains the code for File Signature and don't forget to import magic library 
    and save the file with .py extension.
    For example - python_code_for_file_signature.py
[Python Script](https://github.com/mahtokamal/cybesecurityprojects/blob/main/Python_file_signature_identification/python_code_for_file_signature.py)

### Open a VS Code Terminal
    press CTRL + Backtick(`)  and it will open the terminal into VS Code.

### Navigate the directory location of Script file
    Now you can use cd command to go to path of script file
    syntax - cd path to your directory
    Example - cd C:\Users\KAMAL\Desktop\programs

### Execute and run the script
    
    Syntax - python script_name.py or python -u "complete_path_script_file"
    Example - python python_code_for_file_signature.py or python -u "C:\Users\KAMAL\Desktop\programs\python_code_for_file_signature.py"
