Then We will create a new resource group and name it ‚Äútpot-rg‚Äù as shown in the figure below:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A Resource group is basically a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
> Azure Resource Group includes VMs, storage accounts, virtual networks, web apps, databases and database servers.

This Project will be having some of the resources such as Virtual Machine, Public IP address, Network Security Group,‚Ä¶ etc that will be inside of this resource group.
When you finish with the Honey Pot(T-Pot) lab, all that you need to do is delete the resource group to delete this entire project.
